Basic bibtex to static site generator so you can easily self-archive and help kill
the academic publishing industry.

## Features

* Self-contained
* Works directly from bibtex file
* Included PDF reader
* Can add links to poster, talk recording video, ...
* Abstract display
* Mathjax to render math correctly
* Search function on the list page
* Relatively easy to use (I think)
* Looks cool, relatively easy to customize.

## Usage

1) Create a bibtex file with your references. See included for example.
2) Drop appropriately named pdf files into the "pdf" folder
3) Run genbib.py. Adjust defaults in the file as needed, or pass arguments.

You now have an "index.html" in this folder, and a bunch of paper pages in the "papers" folder.
